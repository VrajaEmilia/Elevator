Internal request=Request made from inside the elevator
External request=Request made from one of the floors buttons

Communication:
	-client -> server: done through htpp requests
	-server -> client: done through server side events

Client:
	using fetchEventSource we listen to messages from the server that tell is if the state or the current floor of an elevator has changed

Server:

Elevator class logic:
	-extends the class Thread
	-when first started it has no floor requests to process so it calls wait(), leaving it hanging until someone notifies the current 	 thread of new requests
        -when it is notified the thread wakes up and begins to process the first request in the queue
	-the elevator moves only by one floor and then it calls Thread.sleep(1000) to simmulate passing time
	-when the current floor of the elevator or the state(UP,DOWN,WAITING,ARRIVED) is changed it fires an event using PropertyChangeSupport notifying the service that the elevator has moved
	-when all the requests are processed wait is called again

BuildingService class logic:
	-building Service has two elevators A and B
	-when the service is created both threads(A and B) start
	-using PropertyChangeListener the service listens for when elevators change their current floor and using a SssEmitter sends the message to all the listeners
	-when an internal request is added to an elevator that request is added to the queue of the respective elevator and the elevator is notified that it can stop waiting
	-when an external request is made: 
		-if both elevators are avaible we add the request to the queue of the one that is closer, or the one that is lower in the 		 case of equality
		-if one elevator is busy we pass that request to the one that is avaible
		-if both are busy we compare their destinations and we pass the request to the one that has the destination closer
ServerSideEventsController logic:
	-has only one get method that returns a SseEmitter 

BuildingController logic:
	-two post methods: one for adding an internal request and one for an external request
